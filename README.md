## The Project:

Develop a Full-stack application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.JS) in pairs.



### Technical Requirements for the backend:

- Have a REST API backend built with ExpressJS, MongoDB and Mongoose, that your React app will communicate with.
- Have a REST API backend with routes that perform all CRUD actions for at least one model (excluding the user model).
- Have two separate repos on GitHub. One repo is for your frontend React application and the other is for your backend REST API.
- Have a backend validation and centralized error handling in your REST API.


## To run the backend code locally follow the next steps:

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

```
Fork + clone this repo
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```
<h2>Environmental variables:</h2>

Create a .env file
```
.env
```

You will need to create the following variables:

```
ORIGIN=TheRunningPortOfYourFrontEnd 
TOKEN_SECRET=your-VERY-secret-SESSION 
```
From your cloudinary account: 
```
CLOUDINARY_NAME=your-CLOUDINARY-name-here
CLOUDINARY_KEY=your-CLOUDINARY-key-here
CLOUDINARY_SECRET=your-CLOUDINARY-secret-here
```

Optional: the port where you want to run locally, otherwise will run by default in port 3000.
